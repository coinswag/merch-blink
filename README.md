## Description

Coinswag is a social commerce platform where creators, nft artists and communities can turn their ideas into custom products and sell globally. Our platform allows creators, brands, and communities to transform their digital assets into physical merchandise, creating a seamless bridge between the digital and physical worlds.

### Metaplex Integration

Coinswag utilizes two key components of the Metaplex product suite:

1. **Digital Asset Standard (DAS) API**: We use the DAS API to fetch and interact with digital asset data on the Solana blockchain. This allows us to seamlessly integrate existing NFTs and digital assets into our merchandise creation process.

## Key Features

1. **NFT-to-Merch Conversion**: Users can import their existing NFTs or create new designs to be printed on physical merchandise.

2. **Blockchain-Verified Limited Editions**: Utilize compressed NFTs to create verifiable scarcity for exclusive merchandise items.

3. **Token-Gated Access**: Implement access control for exclusive merchandise based on NFT ownership or token holdings.

4. **On-Chain Rewards**: Integrate merchandise purchases with existing tokenomics, offering on-chain rewards for buyers.

5. **Global Crypto Payments**: Accept both fiat and cryptocurrency payments, enabling truly global transactions.

6. **Real-Time Analytics**: Track sales, engagement, and inventory using on-chain data.

7. **Automated Fulfillment**: Connect with a global network of print-on-demand services for seamless order fulfillment.
